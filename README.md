# gm_acceleration
A creative racing game for Garry's Mod
***
This is still very early in development. A proper description will be added once the gamemode is feature-complete.
If you want to play this barely working version, here's a quick guide (advanced users only)
```
This is a very VERY early prototype for the acceleration gamemode.
I am extremly reluctant on sharing this in its current state as this isn't AT ALL an arrucare representation of my skills or what I envision this gamemode to be.

Some missing key features include
	Flying - The cars cannot transform into aircrafts (That was how we were going to incorperate the theme)
	Weapons - MarioKart-like weapons
	HUD - There is no HUD

GETTING STARTED:
	#INSTALL#
	1. Get ARCLib (https://github.com/ARitz-Cracker/ARCLib/archive/master.zip) and extract to your addons
	2. Put gm_acceleration in your gamemodes folder
	
	#SETUP#
	1. Open the map you which to race on
	2. An admin must select the "Checkpoint" tool in the "acceleration category"
	3. Make sure the "Position" slider is set to 1
	4. Spawn checkpoint entities
	5. Mark the checkpoints by Left/Right clicking to define the Left/Right poles (Cars will go through the checkpoint in the direction you are facing)
	6. Press reload to confirm the checkpoint position
	8. Repeat steps 5-7 to define the Race Track
	
	#BUILD#
	1. Spawn your garage (Their locations will be saved in future versions)
	2. Build your car using props
	3. When using wheels, tap USE to change rotation direction, hold USE for 1 second to change steering direction
	4. Use the "Assembler" tool to mark all your props, chairs, and wheels
	5. Hold down C to open garage controls
	6. Save your car!
	7. Deploy it

	#RACING#
	1. Type "gm_acceleration race join" to start a race.
	2. Other players will have 30 seconds to do the same
	3. After that, the race starts!
	4. Have fun!
  ```
